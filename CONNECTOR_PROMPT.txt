We are interested in a kind of "connector" crate that will connect an
OTAP dataflow pipeline to another consume through shared memory queues
or channels. We are interested in consume the OTLP bytes payload
representation; if the exporter receives the OTAP representation it
will convert to the other type. The consumer on the other side of a
thread boundary will pull data from the channel, process it, and
return a success or failure status.

We will use a local exporter component (not shared); we will use a
flume bounded channel for the communication between exporter running
in the thread-per-core engine runtime and the consumer which runs in
its own thread. The consumer is likely to be using FFI, and will will
have an interface that returns opaque FFI-friendly identifiers to
associate requests and responses.
